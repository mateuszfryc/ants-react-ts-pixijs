# Ants Simulation
It's a hobby project made with React.js and Pixi.js. It features ants movement and search based pheremones simulation with BVH implementation for spatial partitioning and web workers.

Inspired by C++ work of Pezzza: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GQNPJip2Y&list=PLPiMlUuvmixC-R-5DXE6k2P6FdKn71JGY&ab_channel=Pezzza%27sWork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GQNPJip2Y&list=PLPiMlUuvmixC-R-5DXE6k2P6FdKn71JGY&ab_channel=Pezzza%27sWork)

# Run
Oryginally this was made with React.js and Pixi.js. These days you can get into some Node.js errors and since I'm not going back to this project so you're on your own to fix this.
